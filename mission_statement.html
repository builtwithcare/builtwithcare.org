    <h1>our mission</h1>
    <p class="text">
the “built with care” mission is to provide the younger generation with a deep and meaningful introduction to the world of computers. where to start? by building one.
<br>
<br>
building a computer is a key step in truly understanding computing. it's hands-on, visual, and becomes a lasting memory. in order to build more advanced skills like programming or mechanical engineering, it is key to understand each component inside a computer and how they work together to do what they do.
<br>
<br>

“building” isn’t as complicated as it seems. but, our mentors give an easy to understand introduction to the parts, and guide students through their computer building journey.
<br>
<br>

at the end of the experience, we donate the computer to either the school in which the event is being held at, or a member of the community that is in need of a computer.
