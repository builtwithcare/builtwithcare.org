    <h1>who we are</h1>

    <p class="text">
        "built with care" was founded by <a style="color: #B5F29E;" target="_blank" href="https://asboyer.com">andrew boyer</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        after andrew built his own computer in the spring of his sophomore year of high school (2020), the world of computer science was opened to him.
        <br>
        <br>
        that summer, andrew helped a couple friends build their own computers. he noticed the impact it had on them as well, and he started his own <a target="_blank" style="color:#0AD866;" href="https://www.cybersummercamp.org">summer camp</a> to teach kids about computers and computer security. the catch? it was virtual (due to COVID-19). while the camp taught key principals, it lacked the physical experience of computer building.
        <br>
        <br>
        now, there is an opportunity to bring the physical experience of computer building to kids across the nation. as stated in the "built with care" <a href="./mission_statement.html" style="color:#FF5658;">mission statement</a>, building a computer is a key step in truly understanding computing.
        <br><br>
        our goal is to bring this experience to anyone and everyone who is interested in tech, but doesn't know where to start. <i>this</i> is the start. build your own computer today, build your tech skill set tomorrow.
